# JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation
Unit 14 | Assignment - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
 
Your Task
Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Create a basic HTML web page.

Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
Add an input tag to your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape


Level 3: Paginated Table
Complete all of Level 2 criteria.

Write code that will paginate the table (client-side pagination) and only display a maximum set number of results at a time (e.g. 50 results per page). Use Bootstrap's Pagination Components and write code to handle page changes and calculate the number of results which should appear on each page.

These changes should happen in the DOM using JavaScript, therefore the user should never be directed to another web page as they paginate through the results.
